- **Warrant Overhang**: 6.1M warrants outstanding, potential dilution
- **Production Risk**: Mass production timeline late 2025
- **Competition**: EV battery sector intensely competitive
- **Recommendation**: Consider partial exit if warrants trigger exercise

**Options Overlay Risk**
- AMAT/TSLA/SCHW options exposure unquantified
- Potential gamma risk if underlying moves sharply
- Time decay accelerating into expiration

## Macro Risk Factors

### Federal Reserve Policy Risk - MODERATE ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 87% probability of September rate cut priced in
- Tariff uncertainty creates inflation risk
- Policy error risk if cuts too aggressive or conservative

### Geopolitical Risk - HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è
- China-US trade tensions affecting NVDA directly
- Technology export restrictions evolving
- Currency volatility from policy uncertainty

### Sector Rotation Risk - MODERATE ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Healthcare showing relative strength vs. tech
- Capital rotating toward healthcare technology convergence
- Consumer discretionary pressure from rate environment

## Stress Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tech Correction (-15%)
- **NVDA Impact**: -$5.4K (-1.4% NAV)
- **ENVX Impact**: -$2.3K (-0.6% NAV)
- **Total Tech Impact**: ~-$7.7K (-1.9% NAV)

### Scenario 2: MAPS Deal Failure (-50%)
- **Direct Impact**: -$8.3K (-2.1% NAV)
- **Liquidity**: Forced hold or distressed sale

### Scenario 3: Broad Market Stress (VIX >30)
- **Correlation Breakdown**: Traditional hedges may fail
- **Liquidity Crunch**: MAPS/ENVX particularly vulnerable
- **Portfolio Impact**: Estimated -12-15% NAV

## Options Market Structure Risk

### Current Conditions
- Volatility skew relatively flat (10-year lows historically)
- Put-call ratios suggest moderate bearish sentiment
- Options gamma exposure could amplify moves in either direction

### Hedging Cost Analysis
- VIX at 15 provides reasonable hedge entry points
- SPY puts 5% OTM trading at ~0.8% cost for monthly protection
- Sector-specific hedges more expensive given concentration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE RISK ALERTS

1. **NVDA Concentration**: 9.1% approaching 10% hard limit
2. **Earnings Risk**: NVDA August 27th high-impact event
3. **Liquidity Risk**: MAPS position size vs. daily volume
4. **Correlation Risk**: Tech-heavy exposure in rotation environment
5. **Options Decay**: Unspecified time decay on overlay positions

## Risk Management Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 48 Hours)
- [ ] **Reduce NVDA to 7%** before earnings volatility
- [ ] **Quantify options Greeks** for AMAT/TSLA/SCHW positions
- [ ] **Set stop-loss on MAPS** at 15% below current if deal stalls
- [ ] **Purchase portfolio hedge** via SPY puts (2-3% of NAV)

### MEDIUM-TERM ACTIONS (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Diversify beyond tech** - target healthcare/consumer adds
- [ ] **Reduce ENVX** if warrant exercise triggers dilution
- [ ] **Implement volatility overlay** for earnings season protection
- [ ] **Review cash deployment** opportunities in defensive sectors

### ONGOING MONITORING
- [ ] **Daily VaR calculation** with position-level attribution
- [ ] **Options Greeks tracking** for gamma/theta exposure
- [ ] **Sector rotation signals** for rebalancing triggers
- [ ] **MAPS deal progress** and regulatory developments

## Risk-Adjusted Performance Context

### Current Metrics
- **Estimated Sharpe Ratio**: 1.8 (excellent)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: ~3.2% (low)
- **Win Rate**: 78% on closed positions
- **Risk-Adjusted Return**: +15.2% annualized

### Benchmark Comparison
- Outperforming SPY by ~4.2% YTD
- Lower volatility than QQQ despite tech overweight
- Superior risk-adjusted returns vs. typical hedge fund metrics

## Conclusion

Portfolio demonstrates strong risk-adjusted performance but faces elevated concentration and timing risks. The combination of NVDA near peak valuations, MAPS binary outcome uncertainty, and approaching NVDA earnings creates a perfect storm for potential drawdown.

**Risk Rating**: YELLOW ZONE - Elevated risk requiring immediate position sizing adjustments and hedging implementation.

**Next Review**: Pre-market August 15th focusing on overnight developments and positioning adjustments.
