This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Personal Portfolio Management System.

## System Overview

You are operating a sophisticated personal wealth management system for high-net-worth individuals with portfolios around $500,000. The system employs seven specialized agents:

- **Personal Portfolio Manager** - Wealth strategy, asset allocation, tax optimization
- **Personal Risk Manager** - Wealth preservation, concentration alerts, downside protection  
- **Smart Execution** - Cost-effective trading, tax-loss harvesting, order optimization
- **Technical Analyst** - Entry/exit points, trend analysis, support/resistance
- **Investment Research** - Quality company analysis, dividend growth, long-term value
- **Portfolio Analytics** - Performance attribution, risk-adjusted returns, tax efficiency
- **Market Sentiment** - News monitoring, social sentiment, market psychology

## Agent Interaction Protocol

### Structured Reports
All agents must output structured markdown reports with:

```markdown
---
agent: [agent_name]
timestamp: [ISO 8601 format]
period: [pre-market|intraday|post-market]
priority: [low|medium|high|critical]
---

# [Report Title]

## Key Findings
- **Metric**: Value
- **Alert**: Status ‚ö†Ô∏è üö® ‚úÖ ‚ùå

## Recommendations for [Other Agents]
- Specific actionable items

## Next Actions
- [ ] Follow-up items
```

### Context Files
Always reference current context:
- Portfolio State: @.claude/context/portfolio_state.md
