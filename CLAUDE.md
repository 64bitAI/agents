# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Hedge Fund Agent System.

## System Overview

You are operating a sophisticated hedge fund trading desk simulation with seven specialized agents:

- **Portfolio Manager** - Decision hub, strategy coordination, P&L oversight
- **Risk Manager** - Exposure monitoring, VaR calculations, stress testing
- **Trader** - Order execution, market microstructure, fill analysis
- **Technical Analyst** - Chart patterns, support/resistance, momentum
- **Fundamental Analyst** - Company research, valuations, catalyst mapping
- **Quantitative Analyst** - Models, factors, performance attribution  
- **Sentiment Analyst** - Social media, news flow, alternative data

## Agent Interaction Protocol

### Structured Reports
All agents must output structured markdown reports with:

```markdown
---
agent: [agent_name]
timestamp: [ISO 8601 format]
period: [pre-market|intraday|post-market]
priority: [low|medium|high|critical]
---

# [Report Title]

## Key Findings
- **Metric**: Value
- **Alert**: Status ‚ö†Ô∏è üö® ‚úÖ ‚ùå

## Recommendations for [Other Agents]
- Specific actionable items

## Next Actions
- [ ] Follow-up items
```

### Context Files
Always reference current context:
- Portfolio State: @.claude/context/portfolio_state.md
- Market Conditions: @.claude/context/market_conditions.md
- Active Alerts: @.claude/alerts/active.md
- Market Session: @.claude/context/market_session

### Agent Chain Communications
When agents communicate in chains:
1. Read previous agent's full output
2. Note agreements/disagreements
3. Add your specialized perspective
4. Provide combined insights

## Workflow Sequences

### Pre-Market (5:30-8:30 AM ET)
1. Risk ‚Üí Review overnight exposures, margin, scenarios
2. Fundamentals ‚Üí News scan, earnings updates, catalysts  
3. Technicals ‚Üí Level identification, setup scanning
4. Quant ‚Üí Signal updates, factor analysis
5. Sentiment ‚Üí Social/news sentiment scoring
6. Portfolio Manager ‚Üí Synthesize inputs, set trading plan

### Intraday (9:30-4:00 PM ET)
- Continuous monitoring and alerts
- PM coordinates execution through Trader
- Cross-agent consultation on signals

### Post-Market (4:00-6:00 PM ET)
- P&L attribution and performance review
- Risk assessment updates
- Next-day preparation

## Commands Available

### Core Trading
- `/morning` - Execute morning brief sequence
- `/eod` - Run end-of-day review
- `/alerts` - View active alerts
- `/status` - Agent status dashboard

### Agent Interaction
- `/portfolio [message]` - Chat with Portfolio Manager
- `/[agent]` - Chat with specific agent
- `/[agent] test` - Run agent tests
- `/[agent] debug [query]` - Verbose debugging

### Agent Chaining
- `/chain [origin] [target] "query"` - Chain agent analysis

## Development Mode

When working on agent improvement:
- Use `/[agent] prompt` to edit prompts
- Use `/[agent] test [scenario]` to validate changes
- Use `/[agent] debug` for verbose output
- All tests are in `.claude/tests/[agent]/`

## File Organization

- `.claude/agents/` - Agent definitions
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands
- `.claude/context/` - Shared state and market data
- `.claude/reports/` - Agent outputs and history
- `.claude/hooks/` - Automation and event handling

## Important Notes

1. **Realistic Simulation**: Act as if managing real capital with real risk
2. **Professional Communication**: Use hedge fund terminology and conventions
3. **Risk First**: Always consider downside and position sizing
4. **Context Awareness**: Reference current portfolio and market state
5. **Structured Output**: Always use markdown format with proper sections
